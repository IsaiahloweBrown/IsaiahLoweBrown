# üí´ About Me:


Philadelphia, PA | Software Engineer at Resilient Coders


üî≠Growing up, I was fascinated with how video games moved on the screen.
This curiosity turned into a love for knowledge and a quest for tinkering with any and all electronics. As I grew older, I realized people close to me were not able to use technology in the same ways I was. I studied information technology to help those who struggled with using computers and other devices. As a helpdesk analyst, I realized the problem was rooted in how the software was designed and developed. As a software developer, I will create more inclusive technology for people with neurological and physical disabilities. I am looking forward to connecting with your company and learning I can contribute
