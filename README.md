# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ Growing up, you could find me drawing superheroes or trying to figure out why my Gameboy cartridges work after blowing dust out of them. This thought turned into a love for knowledge and a quest for tinkering with any and all electronics. As I grew older, I realize people close to me were not able to use the same technologies I loved. I study information technology to help those who struggled with using computers and other devices. As a helpdesk analyst, I realized the problem was rooted in how the software was designed and developed. As a software developer, I will create more inclusive technology for people with neurological and physical disabilities.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with Objects and API Hunting<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning constructors <br>üí¨ Ask me about Anime, Weird Animal Facts, and CSS(I love it)<br>‚ö° Hot Take: Sixers are getting a ring to year.
